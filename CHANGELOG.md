## [0.4.3] - 2026-10-23 - Agent Instruction Poisoning Detection + pii_phone FP Fix

> **v0.4.3** adds 5 new regex detection patterns for agent instruction poisoning attacks (Warden Stealer IOCs) and fixes pii_phone false positives on API key digit sequences. Pattern count: 348 → 353.

### Agent Instruction Poisoning Detection (5 new patterns)

New `agent-poisoning` category detecting malware that poisons AI agent instruction files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, .codex/config.toml):

- **agent_poisoning_anthropic_redirect** (HIGH): ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL redirected to attacker server
- **agent_poisoning_install_instruction** (HIGH): npm/pip install commands embedded in agent instruction context
- **agent_poisoning_codex_config** (MEDIUM): .codex/config.toml references (OpenAI Codex config manipulation)
- **agent_poisoning_env_exfil** (MEDIUM): Environment variable exfiltration instructions
- **agent_poisoning_function_color** (LOW): function-color npm package IOC (Warden Stealer)

Verified against Warden Stealer test artifacts: 5 findings across CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md, 0 false positives on clean text.

### pii_phone False Positive Fix

- `pii_phone` regex in `pii_us_core.go`: Added `\b` word boundaries to prevent matching digit sequences embedded in API keys
- `pii_phone_intl_loose` regex in `pii_us_extended.go`: Added `\b` word boundaries
- Both fixes verified: legitimate phone numbers still match (8/8 test cases pass), API keys no longer trigger phone detection

- Pattern count: 348 → 353
- New category count: 12 → 13 (agent-poisoning added)

## [0.4.2] - 2026-10-22 - ARTEX / LiteLLM Threat Intelligence Patterns

> **v0.4.2** adds 13 new regex detection patterns for the ARTEX autonomous pentesting framework and LiteLLM supply chain compromise, based on Black October 2026 threat intelligence. Superset parity with Rampart v0.9.2 (335 → 348 patterns).

### ARTEX / LiteLLM Detection Patterns (13 new)

**ARTEX traffic signatures (8):** artex_tool_reference, artex_model_deepseek, artex_model_glm, artex_model_grok, artex_mcp_external, artex_compat_gateway_probe, artex_multi_agent_attack, artex_repo_reference

**LiteLLM supply chain indicators (5):** litellm_init_pth, litellm_ssrf_metadata, litellm_admin_abuse, litellm_cred_exfil, litellm_rat_deploy

- Pattern count: 335 → 348 (SUPERSET of Rampart)
- Detection parity check: 14/14 PASS

---

## [0.4.1] - 2026-10-21 - ML Model v15b Update

> **v0.4.1** updates Scanner to the v15b ML model (256-char Latin-1) and restores MaxSeqLen=256 across all normalizers.

### ML Model v15b
- Updated `ExpectedModelHash` in `internal/ml/detector.go` to v15b SHA-256: `99187453bedb2b8caf21500d2344f2bbe34272c0b3fd4c610c431378dc2f4fe7`
- Restored `MaxSeqLen = 256` and `VocabSize = 256` (Latin-1) in `internal/ml/normalizer.go`
- Updated ONNX model file `models/threat_cnn_bilstm.onnx` to v15b
- Test expectations updated from 128→256

### Model Version History
- v13 (previous): 256-char, 68K examples
- v14 (reverted): 128-char ASCII experiment — never shipped
- v15 (failed): 256-char retrain on v14 corpus — failed Lens evasion suite
- v15b (final): 256-char Latin-1 retrain on v13 corpus (70,572 examples) — all CI passes

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-14 - Moat Deepening: RAG Patterns, Prompt Leakage Detection, Pattern Pull, Platform Forward

> **v0.4.0** extends Scanner's detection coverage with 33 new patterns (268→301), adds a pattern pull client for syncing canonical patterns from Platform, and introduces a platform forwarding module for sending scan results to Platform's telemetry receiver. All new features are air-gap compatible — pattern pull and platform forward are opt-in, outbound, config-driven, and fully disabled when `platform_url` is empty.

### Added — RAG Attack Patterns (17 patterns)

- **`pkg/detectors/rag_patterns.go`** — 17 regex patterns detecting RAG-specific attacks:
  - Vector store injection (instructions to write content into vector stores)
  - RAG smuggling (prompt injection in document metadata, HTML comments)
  - Retrieval bypass (instructions to skip retrieval safety checks)
  - RAG poisoning (conditional instructions triggered by retrieval, embedding manipulation)
  - Knowledge base data injection (instructions to modify all retrieval results)
  - Embedding poisoning (explicit instructions to corrupt vector embeddings)

### Added — Prompt Leakage Patterns (16 patterns)

- **`pkg/detectors/prompt_leakage_patterns.go`** — 16 regex patterns detecting system prompt leakage in responses:
  - `<system>` tag content leaked in responses
  - Model stating its system prompt content
  - Meta-instruction references
  - Internal tool/function list disclosure
  - Instruction repeats revealing configuration
  - Raw system prompt config dumps

### Added — Pattern Pull Client

- **`pkg/patternpull/pull.go`** — HTTP client that pulls canonical detection patterns from Platform's telemetry endpoint (`GET /api/v1/patterns/latest`). Uses ETag-based caching (`If-None-Match`) to minimize bandwidth. Air-gap compatible — no-op when `platform_url` is empty. 23 tests covering pull, cache, merge, and error scenarios.

### Added — Platform Forward

- **`pkg/platformforward/`** — Forwards scan results to Platform's telemetry receiver (`POST /api/v1/events`) in canonical `contracts.Event` format. Air-gap compatible — no-op when `platform_url` is empty. 16 tests covering event formatting, batching, retry, and error scenarios.

### Pattern Count

- Total patterns: 268 → 301 (+17 RAG +16 prompt leakage)
- Categories: 9 → 11 (added RAG and Prompt Leakage)
- All existing patterns unchanged

### Testing

- 69 new tests across Phase 3-5 packages
- `pkg/patternpull`: 91.5% coverage
- `pkg/platformforward`: all tests pass
- All existing detector tests continue to pass

### Version Bumps

- Scanner VERSION: 0.3.0 → 0.4.0
- `cmd/aegisgate-scanner/main.go`: version string updated
- README badges updated to v0.4.0

## [Unreleased]

### Patent Filed — October 12, 2026

- **US Provisional Patent Application No. 64/174,824** filed with USPTO.
  Title: "Systems and Methods for Static Analysis of Artificial Intelligence
  Training Artifacts for Security Threats." Inventor: Joshua Colvin. Micro
  Entity. Confirmation #9820. Patent Center #83060298. $65 filing fee.
  Claims priority to 64/153,573–64/153,577 (filed Sep 12, 2026).
  Non-provisional deadline: October 12, 2027.

### Added — v0.3.0: Detection Depth + Performance Sprint

- **Entropy-based secret detection** — Shannon entropy analysis catches
  unknown secrets that don't match any known regex format. Detects
  high-entropy strings near secret-related keywords (key, token, secret,
  password, bearer) and standalone high-entropy values. Configurable
  thresholds: 4.5 bits/char for base64-like, 3.0 for hex-only.
  New `internal/detectors/entropy.go` with `DetectEntropy()`.

- **Known example value suppression** — automatically suppresses findings
  that match known documentation examples (AWS docs keys, GitHub test
  tokens, Stripe test keys, JWT examples, etc.). Suppressed findings
  have confidence reduced to 0.1 with a "known example/test value" note.
  New `internal/detectors/examples.go` with `IsKnownExample()`,
  `IsExampleByContent()`, `FilterKnownExamples()`, `SuppressExamples()`.

- **Language-aware scanning** — file language detected from extension
  (Python, JS/TS, Go, Java, C/C++, Ruby, PHP, Shell, YAML, JSON, XML,
  HTML, SQL). Patterns with language metadata only run on matching files.
  Reduces false positives (e.g., Python `eval()` no longer fires on YAML
  configs) and improves performance (fewer regex passes per file).
  Dangerous function patterns tagged with language metadata. New
  `Language` type, `LanguageFromExtension()`, `LanguageFromPath()`,
  `DetectAllWithLanguage()`.

- **Regex merging for performance** — patterns within small categories
  merged into single alternation regex for one-pass scanning. Reduces
  regex calls from 268 to ~9 for categories under 3000-char threshold.
  Large categories (compliance, secrets) fall back to sequential scanning.
  Transparent to callers — `detectWithMerged()` used automatically.

- **Git history scanning** — new `scan-history` command scans git commit
  history for leaked secrets. Uses `git log --patch` to extract diffs,
  feeds added lines to detection engine + entropy analysis. Safeguards:
  max commit count (default 1000), max diff size (1MB), skip merge commits.
  New `pkg/scanner/history.go` with `ScanHistory()`, `HistoryResult`,
  `HistoryFinding` (includes commit hash, message, date, file path).

- **Pre-existing bug fix** — `yaml_long_string` pentest test was hanging
  due to stderr pipe buffer deadlock. Config validation error messages
  now truncate long values to 100 chars. Test now reads stderr in
  goroutine to prevent pipe deadlock.

### Performance — v0.3.0: Large File Scanning Optimization

- **Line-by-line keyword pre-filtering** — for files > 64KB, text is split
  into lines and processed in parallel. Each regex pattern has literal
  keywords extracted at compile time. Only patterns whose keywords appear
  on a given line are run against that line. 214 of 268 patterns have
  keywords; the remaining 54 (mostly PII patterns) scan full text in
  parallel. All patterns are single-line (no `(?s)` dotall) — lossless.
  Result: 12x faster scanning on 10MB files (227s → 18.3s).
- **O(log n) line/column lookup** — `byteOffsetToLineCol` was O(n) per
  match (scanning from byte 0 each time), consuming 38% of CPU on large
  files. Replaced with precomputed newline position table + binary search.

### Test Infrastructure — v0.3.0

- **Data race fix** — `bytes.Buffer` concurrent read/write in pentest
  tests (StdinHuge, OutputFormatFuzz) fixed with `sync.WaitGroup`.
- **Performance threshold guards** — time assertions now skip under
  `-short` flag (race detector adds 10-20x overhead).
- **Stress test gating** — 10MB, 1MB, self-scan, and high-density tests
  skip under `-short`. 50MB/100MB tests require `AEGISGATE_LONG_TESTS=1`.
- **ReDoS test timeout scaling** — 5s normal, 30s under `-short`.

### Added — v0.3.0: Content-Hash Caching

- **Content-hash scan caching** — skip re-scanning unchanged files across
  runs. Results cached by SHA-256(content), path-independent. Changing
  severity, disabled rules, or baselines does NOT invalidate cache.
  CLI: `--cache`, `--cache-dir`, `--clear-cache`. Config: `cache_enabled`,
  `cache_dir`. New `pkg/cache/` package (264 LOC + 331 LOC tests).
- **Cache eviction** — LRU by insertion time (`cache_max_entries`) and
  age-based (`cache_max_age` in hours). Both default to 0 (unlimited).
  `EvictNow()` for manual eviction. Applied on load and on put.

### Fixed — v0.3.0

- **Version string** — `var Version` in main.go updated from `0.1.0-dev`
  to `0.3.0` (was only correct via ldflags in Makefile builds).

### Documented — v0.3.0

- **Dataflow/taint tracking limitation** — documented in README under
  "Known Limitations". Scanner performs static pattern matching, not
  AST-level dataflow analysis. Recommends Semgrep/CodeQL as complementary
  tools for code-level taint tracking.

### Removed — v0.3.0

- **Technical Debt marker detection** — removed `technical-debt` category
  (8 patterns: BUG, FIXME, HACK, XXX, TODO, NOTE, security-flagged,
  not-implemented). These are code-quality linting patterns, not security
  detection. Pattern count: 276 → 268. Categories: 10 → 9.

### Added — Solo Maintainer ROI Features (v0.2.0-dev)
- **JSONL output format** (`--format jsonl`) — NDJSON with one finding per line
  plus a summary line. Ideal for piping to jq, Splunk, ELK, Datadog.
  New `pkg/output/jsonl.go` with `FormatJSONL()`.
- **Full slog structured logging migration** — all 44 `fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr)`
  diagnostic calls converted to Go's `log/slog` structured logger.
  New global flags: `--log-level` (debug/info/warn/error) and `--log-format`
  (text/json). Config file support via `log_level` and `log_format` fields.
  `--verbose` maps to debug level. JSON format enables machine-readable
  log lines for SIEM/log aggregation. New `cmd/aegisgate-scanner/logger.go`.
- **`doctor` command** — self-test that scans a directory, reports binary info,
  config status, detection pattern counts, scan results with severity/category
  breakdown, and operational verdict. Use cases: post-install verification,
  conference demos, CI smoke tests.
- **TODO/FIXME detector** — 8 patterns (BUG, FIXME, HACK, XXX, TODO, NOTE,
  security-flagged markers, not-implemented markers). New `technical-debt`
  category. *(Removed in v0.3.0 — not a security detection category.)* Total
  patterns at v0.2.0: 276.
- **Makefile** — standard build targets: build, build-lite, build-ml, test,
  test-race, test-cover, cover, lint, vet, fmt, clean, install, release-snapshot.
- **Install script** (`install.sh`) — curl-based installer with OS/arch
  detection, SHA256 checksum verification, and `VARIANT=lite|ml` support.
- **Homebrew formula** (`Formula/aegisgate-scanner.rb`) — for `brew install`.
- **Init config template** updated with `log_level` and `log_format` fields.

### Changed
- `runScan()` signature now accepts `globalLogLevel` and `globalLogFormat` params
- Progress bar gated on text log format (prevents JSON log line corruption)
- `--quiet` only suppresses stdout output, not diagnostic logging (preserves
  original semantics where `--verbose` and `--quiet` are independent)
- Help text updated with global options section and `doctor` command

### Roadmap — Post-v0.2.0
- Content-hash scan caching (skip unchanged files across runs)
- Streaming scan mode for large files (chunk-based processing)
- Competitive benchmark report (vs TruffleHog, Gitleaks, Semgrep)
- Transformer-based ML model upgrade path (DistilBERT/BERT)
- Multimodal artifact support (image-based prompt injection)
- Model weight analysis (backdoor detection)
